## Pavegen Power the world with footsteps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VD15-2Uriyc
## Data
1) Footsteps of people stepping on the electric grid floor

## Rendering
1) Motion sensor 
2) Grid like floor to capture kinetic energy
3) electricity on led figment 
4) Rewards on Mobile device for every step 

## Simulation
2) None

## Events / User Input
1) None but the user's movement is captured and converted


## The Treachery of Sanctuary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5__9hq-yas

## Data
1) Posture/movement tracking motor.
2) Image coming in from the camera.
3) 3 panels that reflect the altered silhouette of people in front of them


## Rendering
1) Application of images/animation on body captured. 
2) Image data in panel 1 is converted into the body disintegrating into birds.
3) Image data in panel 2 is converted into the body getting picked apart by birds.
4) Image data in panel 2 is converted into the body sprouting giant wings.

## Simulation
1) None

## Events / User Input
1) None but the user's body is captured and reflected.

## The Treachery of Sanctuary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5__9hq-yas

## Data
1) 3 panels (3 stages), triptych
2) Infrared sensors - shadow of the participants
3) Kinect controllers & Microsoft SDK for skeleton tracking - posture, gesture, movement

## Rendering:
1) Animation applied onto the shadow (shadow formed by the use of softwares)
2) Contrast of Black and White. 
3) The sensors follow the skeleton and the movement

## Simulation:
1) None, participants needed
2) Events/User Input:
3) Using the posture of the participants, animation (each panel has different effects) differs in positions and creates animation on where the shadow is. 

## Events/User Input:
1) Using the posture of the participants, animation (each panel has different effects) differs in positions and creates animation on where the shadow is.
